This was a project to combine their volunteers and introduce a volunteer appreciation program, where the top volunteers get a special edition park badge for their service. It's your job to help complete a program that was partially written by a colleague to help the Park Service determine this season's top volunteers.
This Project used Typescript, JSON and Javascript.
